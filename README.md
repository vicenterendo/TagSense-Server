## üíª Command-line

These arguments customize the behavior of the server.

- `ARG` `--port <port>` Sets the port at which the server should listen.
- `ARG` `--hostname <addr>` Sets the hostname at which the server should listen.
- `ARG` `--pfx <prefix>` Sets the origin airport ICAO code filter for received flights. This filters out any flights whose origin airport's ICAO code doesn't start by the value. <sub>( "**LP**" means only fligths whose origin airport's ICAO code matches **LP**xx will be cached )</sub>
- `SWITCH` `-sqwk` Require received flights to have a valid squawk code.
